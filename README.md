With this course we got introduced to OpenGL 2.1, or more specifically the GLUT frameowrk. The goal of this course and project was to design and develop a 3D graphics application 
and scene that exhibits key techniques in graphics programming using OpenGL. 

###### The code I wrote is in the Scene.h and Scene.cpp files
  
The techniques I have successfuly implemented are:
  
##### Lighting 
- Point light and a spot light
- different properties on the geometry to simulate different reflection values and materials


##### Geometry 
- hand crafted geometry using vertexes
- transparent textures
- depth buffer for the skybox
- hierarchy modelling for planets orbiting a sun
- trilinear filtering for the ground texture 
 
##### Camera
- fully functioning 1st person camera with keyboard and mouse movement
- static birds eye camera

This was an amazing learning experience. I had not used an API before and it was interesting to learn how the render pipeline works. 
The biggest challenge I faced in this project was the calculations for the camera, but with the help of the teaching staff and fellow students I got it working as I wanted 
and understood much better how the math behind it works.
